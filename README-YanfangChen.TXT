Game Rule:

we can use arrow keys to control movement of spider
spider eat fly when touching it(add score by 2);
wasp sting spider when touching it(decrease score by 3); the wasp die after sting the spider by one time;
the spider health decrease by 20 for every sting by wasp;

initial score =0;
initial time = 3600;(equal to 1 minute)
initial spider health = 100
start files = 5  add spider 7, 9,11,13,15,17.................. when the remaining flies is less than 3
start spider = 1    don't  add any more
startwasp s= 2   add one more when died, just to keep there is always two wasps on the window

game is over when any of the three conditions happens:
1. score<0
2. time=0
3. spider health <=0

win or lose:
when player gets more than 20 points before game over, he win, otherwise, he lose.
